## There are some important points for pepole who work in  tech industry : ##
1. The Tutorial Hell 
2. Long Form Of Content 

## The solution is  Learn the general idea fast, and then gradually deep dive in.    the next steps : ##
1.  The Crash Course: go to youtube search for subject that you want to learn.
2. The Personal Project: The goal is to build the must simple project that concludes the ideas learnt in first step. All you need to care about is to see how you can build something alone.
3.  The Deep Dive : know you have get to know the entire power of the technology beyond the basic use of it, and if possible, how does it work under the hood

The first thing that you would do is go through the documentation.
After that you can go in any direction you want. That is also the time to bring the 'Heavy Guns' like those 40-hrs long courses.
